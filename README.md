# Google Data Analytics Certificate (Archived)

## Overview
This repository contains all the notes and files I created while completing the **Google Data Analytics Certificate** course on Coursera.

At the time, I was not using Git or GitHub regularly, so the file structure may be slightly unorganized. Initially, I did not intend to share these notes publicly, but I now find it valuable to archive them here as evidence of my work and learning experience.

Some notes were exported from **Joplin** (Courses 1–4), while others were exported from **Microsoft OneNote** (Courses 5–8). You may notice occasional formatting issues or images that do not display correctly.

Despite these minor issues, I hope this repository provides a clear insight into my skills and understanding as a developing data analyst.
